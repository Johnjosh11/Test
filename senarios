What if you want to write something and collaborate with others. 
Best solution is Git at present and worldwidely accepted one

I want to write something and store. Ok (filezilla, ftp, drive, pendrive, etc..,)
I want to know what i have changed and what time i have changed (git add, commit, push)

I have added something in the staging but dont want to add in this staging (dont add it in the git staging) as simple as that. 
I have already added but wanted to take out from staging. (git reset head and file name)
I wanted that file to be empty and write from the begining (git checkout filename)
what if i have staged the file and added in the commit area but wanted to bring out of this commit (git reset hard head filename)

I wanted other people also to contribute to my code as this is opensource code but privately to selected members (git create branches and share it with other users)

[other peopole should clone your project to contribute so they should use (git clone url)]

How to change branches (git checkout)

How do i change branch with out letting/effecting my current branch changes to other branch which am switching (git stash)
Now i switch back to the original branch which i am merging and get back the previous modifications (git pop)

I see that the developer has given good solution to my project an wanted to include that code in my master branch (git merge) or (git rebase)

I wanted to integrate git with other tools and do some automations with the merge or push (git webhooks)

I see that some part of the code looks pretty good and would like to make it available to the public or make it standered version and continuew developing (git tag)

I wanted to see current status of all the contributers till now (git fetch)

I wanted to check the logs (git log) or in a graphical mode (git log --graph)
