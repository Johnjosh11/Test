1) Git is a version control system. 
2) Clone:To completely cone central repo to local system
   add  :To make the current local repo as the git initial path. 
3) To make sure what/why changes are made in perticular commits
4) Git Merge. Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. 
   The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch. 
   Note that all of the commands presented below merge into the current branch.

    In Git, the rebase command integrates changes from one branch into another. 
    It is an alternative to the better known "merge" command. Most visibly, 
    rebase differs from merge by rewriting the commit history in order to produce a straight, 
    linear succession of commits.
5) git fetch really only downloads new data from a remote repository 
  but it doesn't integrate any of this new data into your working files. 
  Fetch is great for getting a fresh view on all the things that happened in a remote repository.

  git pull, in contrast, is used with a different goal in mind: to update your current HEAD branch with the latest changes from the remote server. 
  This means that pull not only downloads new data; 
  it also directly integrates it into your current working copy files. This has a couple of consequences
8) git checkout filename (Please explaing in brief)
10) add the fies in .gitognore file which will not upload it to central repo
